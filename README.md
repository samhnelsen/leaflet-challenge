# leaflet-challenge

For this challenge, I am helping the United States Geological Survey, or USGS, with building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

You'll find my logic.js and styel.css both in the static folder.
